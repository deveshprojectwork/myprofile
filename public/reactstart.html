                <h1>Setting up a React Environment</h1><br />
                If you have NPM and Node.js installed, you can create a React application by first installing the create-react-app.
                If you've already created the create-react-app you can skip this section.<br />
                Install create-react-app by running this command in your terminal: <br /><br />
                C:\Users\Your Name&gt;<b>npm install -g create-react-app</b><br />
                Then you are able to create a React application, let's create one called myfirstreact.
                Run this command to create a React application named myfirstreact:<br /><br />
                C:\Users\Your Name&gt;<b>npx create-react-app myfirstreact</b><br />
                The create-react-app will set up everything you need to run a React application.<br />
                Run the React Application<br />
                Now you are ready to run your first real React application!<br />
                Run this command to move to the myfirstreact directory:<br /><br />
                C:\Users\Your Name&gt;<b>cd myfirstreact</b><br />
                Run this command to run the React application myfirstreact:<br /><br />
                C:\Users\Your Name\myfirstreact&gt;<b>npm start</b><br />
                A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App! If not, open your browser and type localhost:3000 in the address bar.
                </div>
            </div>
          )
        }
      }

      ReactDOM.render(<Hello />, document.getElementById('mydiv'))
    </script>
